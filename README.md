# 🧮 Calculator

A simple, functional calculator built with **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.  
This project is part of my learning journey through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## ✨ Features

- Handle **decimal numbers** with ease.
- Round results to **5 decimal places** for cleaner outputs.
- 🖥Display a **summary of operations** (e.g., `5 + 3`) before showing the result.
- Handle basic **errors** (e.g., division by zero returns **"ERROR"**).
- **Clear current entry** or **reset** the entire calculator at any time.
